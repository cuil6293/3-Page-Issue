<h1 class = "head1-info">Why are glaciers melting?</h1>
<div class = info>
	<p>Glaciers and ice caps are rapidly melting due to human businesses and activities. Since the Industrial Revolution, greenhouse gas emissions have just steadily been increasing, aiding to global warming. As a result, Antartica is now losing about 150 billions tons of ice mass per year, while Greenland is losing about 270 billion tons per year.</p>

	<p>Below you will see the drastic decrease in Greenland's mass due to the increase in the melting of glaciers.</p>

<h1 class = "head1-info">What issues is this causing?</h1>
<div class="info">
	<p>One of the most obvious problems with the melting of the glaciers and ice caps is the increasing sea levels. This means a higher risk of flooding in coastal areas and higher amounts of people displaced due to it. The people who will be worst affected though are those who can't simply afford to move elsewhere and start anew.</p>
	<p>Furthermore, melting glaciers make their own situation worse as they can release bacteria that will then consume frozen organic matter and release carbon dioxide. These same melting glaciers are also the ones that trap ancient reservoirs of methane.</p>
	<p>Finally, the creatures who dwell in the cold temperatures of the Arctic are rapidly losing their habitat in chunks and are possibly well on their way to extinction in the wild.</p>
